# Console Finances

## Overview

I have created code that analyses the financial records of  a company

* The dataset is composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
* The  JavaScript code  analyses the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset.
  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

 
## Instructions

When you open this code in the console of your browser the resulting analysis will look like this:
